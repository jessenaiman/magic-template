# Feature Specification: Fix All Lint Errors

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-all-lint`  
**Created**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: **Input**: User description: "fix all lint errors that are not part of components/ui|magicui|animate-ui. Do not hide errors. Work methodically through file at a time until they individually are properly refactored to compile. Use codacy reports and linting errors from constant review to bring the project to zero linting errors with the exception of src/components/[ui|magiui|animate-ui]. If codacy is reporting these 3rd party installations as errors reinstall the components. DO NOT MAKE 100s of edits when the issue will ALWAYS be the configuration is not correct. install shadcn cli terminal commands as can be found ONLY by referencing your mcp tools, failure to check your tools will destroy progress. Check in and push code to github for review after every major change. Check linting immediately after coding and if the number of errors is higher you cannot submit that as completed"

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to fix all lint errors in the project except those in src/components/ui, magicui, and animate-ui directories, so that the codebase compiles cleanly and maintains code quality standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** there are lint errors outside the excluded directories, **When** I fix them methodically, **Then** the project has zero lint errors in those areas.
2. **Given** codacy reports 3rd party installations as errors, **When** I reinstall the components, **Then** the errors are resolved.
3. **Given** configuration issues cause multiple errors, **When** I correct the configuration instead of making hundreds of edits, **Then** the errors are fixed efficiently.
4. **Given** I make changes, **When** I check linting and errors are higher, **Then** I cannot submit the changes as completed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when shadcn cli installation is required?
- How does the system handle if mcp tools are not available?
- What if pushing to github fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fix all lint errors outside src/components/ui, magicui, animate-ui directories
- **FR-002**: System MUST work methodically through files one at a time
- **FR-003**: System MUST use codacy reports and linting errors for review
- **FR-004**: System MUST bring project to zero linting errors in specified areas
- **FR-005**: System MUST reinstall components if codacy reports 3rd party as errors
- **FR-006**: System MUST correct configuration instead of making hundreds of edits
- **FR-007**: System MUST install shadcn cli using mcp tools
- **FR-008**: System MUST check in and push code to github after major changes
- **FR-009**: System MUST check linting immediately after coding
- **FR-010**: System MUST not submit changes if lint errors are higher

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Lint Error**: Represents code quality issues identified by linters
- **Configuration**: Project settings that affect linting behavior
- **Component**: Reusable UI elements that may need reinstallation
