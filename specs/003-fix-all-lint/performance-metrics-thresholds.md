# Performance Metrics & Thresholds

## Overview

This document defines the performance metrics and quality thresholds that will be used to measure the success of the lint error fixing project.

## Quality Metrics

### Lint Error Metrics

- **Target**: Zero lint errors in all target directories
- **Acceptable Threshold**: Maximum 5 minor style warnings per file
- **Critical Threshold**: Any blocking errors that prevent build/deployment

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Maximum 10 per function
- **Function Length**: Maximum 50 lines per function
- **File Length**: Maximum 300 lines per file
- **Type Coverage**: Minimum 95% TypeScript strict type usage

### Performance Metrics

- **Build Time**: Maximum 2 minutes for full build
- **Lint Time**: Maximum 30 seconds for full lint check
- **Test Execution**: Maximum 5 minutes for full test suite
- **Bundle Size**: No increase > 5% from baseline

## Error Classification

### Critical Errors (Blockers)

- TypeScript compilation errors
- Runtime-breaking issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Build failures
- **Threshold**: Must be fixed immediately (same day)

### High Priority Errors

- React key prop warnings
- Memory leaks
- Accessibility violations
- Performance issues
- **Threshold**: Must be fixed within 1 week

### Medium Priority Errors

- Unused imports/variables
- Code style violations
- Documentation issues
- **Threshold**: Must be fixed within 2 weeks

### Low Priority Errors

- Minor formatting issues
- Optional optimizations
- **Threshold**: Nice-to-have, fix when convenient

## Progress Tracking Metrics

### Daily Metrics

- Files processed per day
- Errors fixed per day
- Error reduction percentage
- Time spent per error category

### Weekly Metrics

- Overall error reduction
- Code quality improvement
- Build stability
- Team productivity

### Project Metrics

- Total errors at start vs end
- Time to completion
- Error recurrence rate
- Maintenance overhead reduction

## Validation Thresholds

### Pre-Fix Validation

- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% before making changes
- **Build Status**: Must pass before starting fixes
- **Backup**: Recent backup must exist

### Post-Fix Validation

- **Functionality**: All existing features must work
- **Performance**: No degradation > 5%
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained
- **Security**: No new vulnerabilities introduced

## Risk Thresholds

### High Risk

- Changes affecting > 10 files
- Core functionality modifications
- Database schema changes
- **Mitigation Required**: Code review + testing

### Medium Risk

- Changes affecting 3-10 files
- UI component modifications
- Configuration changes
- **Mitigation Required**: Peer review

### Low Risk

- Changes affecting 1-2 files
- Documentation updates
- Minor refactoring
- **Mitigation Required**: Self-review

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Success Criteria

- ✅ Reduce lint errors by 80%
- ✅ No critical/blocking errors remaining
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ All high-priority errors fixed
- ✅ Documentation updated

### Target Success Criteria

- ✅ Zero lint errors in target directories
- ✅ Code quality metrics improved by 20%
- ✅ Performance maintained or improved
- ✅ Accessibility compliance verified
- ✅ Team productivity increased

### Stretch Goals

- ✅ Zero warnings in entire codebase
- ✅ Automated lint checking in CI/CD
- ✅ Developer training completed
- ✅ Process documentation comprehensive

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Daily Reporting

- Error count by category
- Files processed
- Time spent
- Blockers identified

### Weekly Reporting

- Progress against timeline
- Quality metric trends
- Risk assessment
- Team feedback

### Final Reporting

- Complete before/after analysis
- Lessons learned
- Process improvements
- Success metrics achieved

## Escalation Thresholds

### Immediate Escalation

- Build broken for > 1 hour
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Data loss or corruption
- **Action**: Notify technical lead immediately

### High Priority Escalation

- Progress blocked for > 1 day
- Complex issue requiring architecture decision
- External dependency issues
- **Action**: Escalate to project manager within 4 hours

### Standard Escalation

- Progress delayed
- Resource constraints
- Scope changes needed
- **Action**: Document and escalate weekly

## Tools & Automation

### Automated Monitoring

- ESLint integration in IDE
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline checks
- Code quality dashboards

### Manual Monitoring

- Weekly code reviews
- Monthly architecture reviews
- Quarterly security audits
- Annual performance assessments
