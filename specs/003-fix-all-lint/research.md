# Research: Fix All Lint Errors

## Decision: Use ESLint with Next.js Configuration
**Rationale**: The project is a Next.js application with TypeScript, and ESLint is the standard linting tool for this stack. The existing configuration in `eslint.config.mjs` should be maintained and enhanced rather than replaced.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- TSLint: Deprecated in favor of ESLint
- Prettier only: Lacks semantic analysis for TypeScript
- Biome: Promising but less mature ecosystem support

## ESLint Rules Analysis
**Common Error Patterns Identified**:
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: Remove unused imports and variables
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: Replace `any` with specific types or `unknown`
- `react/no-unescaped-entities`: Escape apostrophes in JSX
- `react/no-children-prop`: Use children prop correctly in React components
- `jsx-a11y/role-supports-aria-props`: Use correct ARIA attributes for roles
- `@typescript-eslint/no-confusing-void-expression`: Handle void expressions properly

**Best Practices**:
- Fix errors methodically, one file at a time
- Use TypeScript's strict typing instead of `any`
- Ensure accessibility compliance with jsx-a11y rules
- Maintain code readability while fixing lint issues

## Codacy Integration
**Decision**: Use Codacy reports to identify additional issues beyond local ESLint
**Rationale**: Codacy provides cloud-based analysis that may catch issues missed locally
**Usage**: Check Codacy dashboard for security and complexity issues

## Configuration Strategy
**Decision**: Fix configuration issues first before individual file edits
**Rationale**: Configuration problems can cause widespread errors that are resolved centrally
**Approach**: Review `eslint.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, and other config files for issues

## Excluded Directories
**Decision**: Exclude `src/components/ui`, `src/components/magicui`, `src/components/animate-ui`
**Rationale**: These are third-party component libraries that should not be modified
**Handling**: If Codacy reports issues in these directories, consider updating the packages rather than editing source code

## Git Workflow
**Decision**: Commit and push after major changes
**Rationale**: Maintain version control and enable review of changes
**Process**: 
- Stage changes after fixing a logical group of files
- Push to branch for CI/CD validation
- Ensure no new lint errors are introduced
