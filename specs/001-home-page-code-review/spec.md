# Feature Specification: Home Page Code Review and Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `001-home-page-code-review`  
**Created**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Input**: User description: "This project needs a very thorough code review. Anything that is in the wrong place, named incorrectly, bad practices, duplications, violations of code architectures, and everything else that is required or expected needs to be addressed.

The playwright tests need a complete rewrite and installation where the only first tests that I see fun are the home page loads and the user can scroll to the bottom past all the components on the landing page.

## Requirements

1. It is a requirement that at least one mcp tool to validate external up to date documentation using context7, web search tools, or deepwiki
2. It is a requirement that the filesystem tool is used to review the project structure before proposing any changes and verified after
3. All completed tasks need to have a task code-review markdown file that can be submitted to the code review team
4. Enforced Code Standards: uses proper current released packages of nextjs, magicui (/src/components/magicui), shadcn (/src/components/ui) which magicui uses), animate-ui (/src/components/animate-ui, also a radixui and shadecn), or reacbits (/src/components/[UpperCase].tsx.
   - Each use of these must include a tool call to review documentation before attempting to modify or use any.
   - Installation must be through CLI, no exceptions

## Goal

A starting page that has zero errors loading and scrolling to the bottom of the page. The page uses lazy loading to conserve memory. The page uses transitions from nextjs instead of custom solutions"

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining this project, I need a thoroughly reviewed codebase with all issues fixed, proper naming, no duplications, adherence to architecture, and a landing page that loads without errors, scrolls smoothly to the bottom with all components, using lazy loading and Next.js transitions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project codebase, **When** a code review is performed, **Then** all misplaced files are moved, incorrect names are corrected, bad practices are fixed, duplications are removed, and architecture violations are addressed.
2. **Given** the Playwright tests, **When** they are rewritten, **Then** only tests for home page load and scroll to bottom are present.
3. **Given** the landing page, **When** loaded, **Then** zero errors occur.
4. **Given** the landing page, **When** scrolled to bottom, **Then** all components load lazily without memory issues.
5. **Given** the page transitions, **When** used, **Then** Next.js transitions are used instead of custom solutions.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component has an error during load?
- How does the system handle outdated packages?
- What if lazy loading fails?
- How are code review findings documented?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST perform thorough code review using MCP tools (context7, web search, or deepwiki) to validate external up-to-date documentation for each of the required packages (Next.js, MagicUI, Shadcn, Animate-UI, ReactBits), identifying and fixing misplaced files, incorrect naming, bad practices, duplications, and architecture violations.
- **FR-002**: System MUST rewrite Playwright tests focus on the home page loading and scroll to bottom tests. This includes checking for all warnings, errors.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use filesystem tools to review project structure before changes and verify after.

## Tool Usage and Information Location

### MCP Tool Setup and Validation

**MCP Server Configuration**: MCP servers are configured in the workspace's `.vscode/mcp.json` file. This file defines server connections for documentation validation, filesystem operations, and component management.

**Current MCP Configuration** (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "playwright": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"],
            "type": "stdio"
        },
        "deepwiki": {
            "url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/sse"
        },
        "filesystem": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/adam/Dev/magic-template/"],
            "type": "stdio"
        },
        "desktop-commander": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest"],
            "type": "stdio"
        },
        "memory": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
            "type": "stdio"
        },
        "@magicuidesign/mcp": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@magicuidesign/mcp@latest"],
            "type": "stdio"
        },
        "shadcn": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["shadcn@latest", "mcp"],
            "type": "stdio"
        }
    }
}
```

**MCP Tool Validation Process**:

1. **Before any code changes**: Use `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` to resolve library names to Context7-compatible IDs
2. **Documentation validation**: Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` to fetch up-to-date documentation
3. **Component validation**: Use `mcp_magicuidesig_getUIComponents` and `mcp_shadcn_list_items_in_registries` for component verification
4. **Filesystem operations**: Use `mcp_filesystem_*` tools for project structure review
5. **Memory management**: Use `mcp_memory_*` tools for code standards storage and retrieval

**Validation Requirements**:

- All MCP tools must be tested and functional before use
- Documentation must be validated using Context7, web search, or DeepWiki before any library modifications
- Component usage must be verified against current documentation
- File structure changes must be validated using filesystem tools before and after modifications

### Filesystem Tool Usage
To verify file structure before proposing changes and after verification:

**Example Call**: Use `mcp_filesystem_list_directory` with path="/home/adam/Dev/magic-template/src/components" to list component directories.

**Example Call**: Use `mcp_filesystem_directory_tree` with path="/home/adam/Dev/magic-template" for full project tree view.

### MagicUI and Shadcn Component Management
To read and understand available components:

**MagicUI**: Use `mcp_magicuidesig_getUIComponents` to list all Magic UI components.

**Shadcn**: Use `mcp_shadcn_list_items_in_registries` with registries=["@shadcn"] to list available items.

To demonstrate no duplication and correct CLI reinstall command:

**Shadcn Reinstall Command**: `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name] --overwrite`

For broken 3rd party components, solutions are:

1. Reinstall and overwrite
2. Uninstall and use a similar alternative component
3. Pause and ask for user input

### Memory Management
Code standards are stored in memory with table of contents style index.

**To Retrieve Code Standards Memory**:

- Use `mcp_memory_search_nodes` with query="Code Standard" to find all standards
- Use `mcp_memory_open_nodes` with names=["Next.js", "MagicUI", "Shadcn", "Animate-UI", "ReactBits"] to retrieve specific standards
- Use `mcp_memory_read_graph` to view the entire knowledge graph

**To Store New Information**:

- Use `mcp_memory_create_entities` to create new entities
- Use `mcp_memory_add_observations` to add observations to existing entities
- Use `mcp_memory_create_relations` to create relations between entities
- Update the table of contents index when new information is added
