# Feature Specification: Consistent Design Page Layout & Customization

**Feature Branch**: `004-1-this-page`  
**Created**: September 13, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "1. This page is the near complete final design and layout that needs to be applied to every page in the design directory so the customize options are being implemented. Currently there are linting errors becuase this was not completed
2.Fix responsive layout of preview-tiles. They should expand to fill the available visible space but there is a lot of space on the left and right on a desktop view, and it may be broken on mobile and tablet.
- to fix this review the preview components or it's one the design/layout implementation
- opening customization should make the preview tile center screen and not be larger than the display size. The current effect is jarring, the ui should expand and display a different layout made for customization
- the example when expanding should be larger, but with enough room to view all the customization options without scrolling
- customization options should be responsive and designed using shadcn components that and tailwindcss that optimizes screen real estate for every responsive display size.
3. Customization must be implemented at least with default options for every design page. Default options are set on the shared layout.tsx file one directory above that page. KISS and do not code defaults on every page.tsx. All per-category layouts (e.g., text, effects, backgrounds, etc.) must be pass-throughs, delegating layout and context to the shared design layout.
4. Refactor and simplify all repetition and duplication of logic and code. Remove redundant wrappers, navbars, and configurators from per-category layouts. All layout and customization logic should be centralized in the shared design layout.

## Rules

- Functionality must be implemented, and cannot be removed to make customization work.
- KISS means that anything repeated with design pages must be refactored into the layout pages. 

Final Steps
Review the design/layout.tsx for inconsistencies that need to be addressed for responsive design. Provide a detailed report of outstanding issues and check in the code for review.

## Refactor Note (2025-09-13)
- All per-category layouts are now pass-throughs. Layout and customization logic is centralized in the shared design layout. This ensures maintainability, consistency, and eliminates code duplication. See tasks.md and research.md for rationale and implementation details.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits any design page and expects a consistent, responsive layout with visible customization options. The preview tiles should fill the available space on all devices, and customization controls should work with sensible defaults.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens any design page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the layout and customization panel are consistent with the reference implementation.
2. **Given** a user resizes the browser (desktop, tablet, mobile), **When** preview tiles are displayed, **Then** they expand to fill available space without excessive margins or layout breakage.
3. **Given** a user interacts with customization controls, **When** no input is provided, **Then** default options are applied and visible in the preview.
4. **Given** a developer reviews the code, **When** repeated layout logic is found, **Then** it is refactored into shared layout components per KISS principle.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a design page omits customization options? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this be a lint error or fallback to defaults?]
- How does the system handle extremely small or large screen sizes?
- What if a preview component fails to render?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: All design pages MUST use a consistent layout and customization panel as per the reference implementation.
- **FR-002**: Preview tiles MUST expand to fill available space responsively on all screen sizes.
- **FR-003**: Customization controls MUST be present and apply default options if no user input is provided.
- **FR-004**: Functionality of preview components MUST NOT be removed or reduced to enable customization.
- **FR-005**: Repeated layout logic across design pages MUST be refactored into shared layout components (KISS principle).
- **FR-006**: Linting errors related to incomplete customization or layout MUST be resolved.
- **FR-007**: The design/layout.tsx file MUST be reviewed for responsive inconsistencies and a report provided.
- **FR-008**: Outstanding issues in responsive design MUST be documented and checked in for review.
- **FR-009**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should missing customization options on a page block deployment or just warn?]

### Key Entities
- **Design Page**: Represents a UI page in the design directory, containing preview tiles and customization controls.
- **Preview Tile**: A component that displays a UI element with live customization.
- **Customization Option**: A user-editable field that changes the appearance or behavior of a preview tile, with a default value.
- **Layout Component**: Shared structure for consistent design page appearance and responsive behavior.
