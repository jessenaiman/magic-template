# Contract: Design Page Customization API (Placeholder)

> NOTE: No external API endpoints required for this feature. All customization and layout logic is handled client-side in the Next.js app. This file is a placeholder for future contract tests if server-side customization or persistence is added.

## Example (for future extension)

### GET /api/design-page/:id
- Returns: DesignPage entity with customization options and preview tiles

### PATCH /api/design-page/:id/customization
- Body: { customizationOptions: CustomizationOption[] }
- Returns: Updated DesignPage

---

For now, all contract tests are satisfied by client-side logic and UI validation.
