# Research for Consistent Design Page Layout & Customization

## Unknowns and Clarifications
- What should happen if a design page omits customization options? [Pending: Should this be a lint error or fallback to defaults?]
- Should missing customization options on a page block deployment or just warn? [Pending]
- What is the minimum supported screen size for responsive design? [Pending]

## Best Practices
- Use a single layout component for all design pages to enforce consistency (KISS principle).
- Customization options should be defined in the layout, not repeated in each page.
- Responsive design should be tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- Use shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS for all customization controls and layout.
- Preview tiles should use CSS grid/flexbox to fill available space and avoid excessive margins.
- When customization is open, preview tile should center and expand, but not exceed viewport size; controls should remain visible without scrolling.

## Decisions
- All customization defaults will be set in the shared layout component.
- Linting will warn (not block) if customization options are missing, but fallback to defaults.
- Minimum supported screen width: 320px (common mobile breakpoint).

## Alternatives Considered
- Duplicating customization logic in each page (rejected: violates KISS, increases maintenance).
- Allowing pages to define their own layout (rejected: inconsistent UX, more code duplication).

## Rationale
- Centralizing customization and layout logic ensures maintainability, consistency, and easier updates.
- Responsive design is critical for accessibility and usability across devices.
