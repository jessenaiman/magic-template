## 1. Next.js: Page Transitions, Lazy Loading, and Improvements over React

- **Page Transitions**: Next.js uses the App Router and React Suspense to enable streaming and granular loading states. The `useLinkStatus` hook and custom loading components (e.g., `loading.tsx`) provide visual feedback during navigation. Prefetching is automatic with `next/link` and can be triggered programmatically for faster transitions.
- **Lazy Loading**: Next.js supports lazy loading via `next/dynamic` for components and native browser lazy loading for images. Dynamic imports can be client-only (`ssr: false`) or use custom loading fallbacks. React Suspense boundaries allow streaming and partial prerendering.
- **Improvements over React**: Next.js adds server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, image/font optimization, and built-in routing. It enables streaming, partial prerendering, and more intentional loading states, reducing layout shifts and network waterfalls.

## 2. Tailwind CSS: Inclusion and Version

- **Inclusion**: Tailwind CSS is included in the main stylesheet using `@import "tailwindcss";` at the top of `app/globals.css`.
- **Location**: The stylesheet is located at `app/globals.css`.
- **Version**: The use of `@import "tailwindcss";` (not `@tailwind ...;`) and the presence of `@import "tw-animate-css";` indicate Tailwind CSS v4 is used (per Tailwind v4 migration docs and shadcn/ui docs for v4 projects).

## 3. shadcn: Integration with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

- **Integration**: shadcn/ui provides a set of UI components that are installed into `/components/ui` and styled with Tailwind CSS. The project uses `components.json` to configure Tailwind integration (`cssVariables: true`, `css: "app/globals.css"`). shadcn/ui leverages Next.js for routing and rendering, and Tailwind for utility-first styling and theming via CSS variables. This enables consistent, themeable UI primitives that work seamlessly in the Next.js app.

## 4. Project Directory Structure

- Root files: AGENTS.md, components.json, LICENSE.md, README.md, next.config.ts, package.json, postcss.config.mjs, tsconfig.json, etc.
- Key folders:
  - `app/`: Next.js app directory (routes, layout, globals.css, etc.)
  - `components/`: All React components, including `/ui` for shadcn components
  - `assets/`, `constants/`, `docs/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `public/`, `style/`, `tests/`, `utils/`
- Example subfolders: `app/api/`, `app/design/`, `app/templates/`, `components/animate-ui/`, `components/magicui/`, `components/ui/`

## 5. Architecture: Design Categories and Preview-Tile Components

- **Design categories** are defined by base option sets (e.g., `base-category-options.ts`) that provide field configs for customization (text, color, etc.).
- **Preview-tile** components (`preview-tile.tsx`) render individual design/component examples, using context from `preview-context.tsx` for customization state.
- **Preview-customization-panel** and related components render dynamic controls based on field configs.
- **Design-page-hero** and **design-management-bar** orchestrate the UI for customizing and previewing categories, passing settings to preview tiles.
- The architecture is context-driven: category options → customization context → preview tile rendering, enabling live, interactive previews for each design/component example.
