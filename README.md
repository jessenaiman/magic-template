# Testing

This monorepo uses a modern, minimal test stack:

- **Unit:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (jsdom)
- **E2E/Smoke/Links:** [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Quick Start

1. Add tests in `apps/web/tests/smoke/` (smoke) and `apps/web/tests/links/` (link checks).
2. Run unit tests:

    ```bash
    pnpm --filter apps/web test:unit
    ```

3. Run smoke tests (site must be running):

    ```bash
    PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 pnpm --filter apps/web test:smoke
    ```

4. Run link tests:

    ```bash
    PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 pnpm --filter apps/web test:links
    ```

## CI

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the full pipeline: build ‚Üí start ‚Üí smoke ‚Üí links.

## Shared Config

Test config is centralized in `packages/test` for easy reuse across apps.
# Web Design Workshop

## üëã Welcome!

Whether you're a seasoned developer, a designer, a manager, or just starting your coding journey, welcome! This project was born from a simple idea: to make communicating web design concepts easier, faster, and more interactive.

Often, countless hours are lost in back-and-forth revisions because static mockups and verbal descriptions can't capture the feeling of a live, interactive component. This workshop provides a collection of tangible, working examples that anyone can see, touch, and customize. It aims to be a common ground where developers, designers, and stakeholders can collaborate more effectively and bring ideas to life with less friction.

## ü§ù Let's Build Together: Contributing & Collaboration

### Development Issues

If you encounter build or development issues, check the available prompt files in `.github/prompts/`:

- **`fix-import-paths.prompt.md`** - For resolving Turborepo import path and module resolution issues

These prompts are designed to be used with AI coding agents for systematic problem resolution.

### Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Here's how you can get involved:

This project is just getting started, and contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn and create. I warmly welcome contributors of all skill levels.

### How You Can Help

Not sure where to start? Here are a few ideas for contributions that would make a huge impact (from easiest to more involved):

-   üé® **Add a New Example:** Find a cool animation or component online? Try recreating it and adding it to the gallery.
-   üìù **Improve Documentation:** See a typo or an explanation that could be clearer? Fix it!
-   üíæ **Implement a "Save Feature":** Add a button to the customization panel that allows users to save or export the code for their tweaked component.
-   üóÇÔ∏è **Propose a New Category:** Think of a category of components we're missing? Open an issue to suggest it and help build it out.

If you're interested, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!

Additionally, I'm always open to collaborating on other open-source projects. If you have an idea you're passionate about, please don't hesitate to reach out.
