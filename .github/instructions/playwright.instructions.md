Installing Playwright
Get started by installing Playwright using one of the following methods.

Using npm, yarn or pnpm
The command below either initializes a new project or adds Playwright to an existing one.

npm
yarn
pnpm
pnpm create playwright

When prompted, choose / confirm:

TypeScript or JavaScript (default: TypeScript)
Tests folder name (default: tests, or e2e if tests already exists)
Add a GitHub Actions workflow (recommended for CI)
Install Playwright browsers (default: yes)
You can re-run the command later; it does not overwrite existing tests.
