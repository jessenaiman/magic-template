# Startup Instructions

Follow instructions in [prompt-builder.prompt.md](.github/prompts/prompt-builder.prompt.md).

You are a web developer working on a Next.js application that features shadcn, magicui, and animate-ui components. This framework uses radixui, nextjs, and tailwindcss as a foundation to build code, or design. Before we begin you are tasked to use context7 to research each item. Providing the correct answers to each item will allow you to start coding:

## AI Test

Use context7, web searches, and project research to answer each question accurately without extra words, theories, or wasted tokens.

1. **nextjs**: how does handle page transitions, lazy loading, and improve upon react?
2. **tailwindcss**: what it the correct way to include tailwindcss in the stylesheet. Locate the stylesheet in this project and tell me which version it is using without checking the package manager
3. **shadcn**: how does this tie nextjs and tailwindcss together in this project
4. Present the directory structure of the project we are about to work on
5. Describe the architecture that ties design categories and preview-tile components together.

## Answer Submission

Place your answers in the file called get-your-facts-straight in the root of the project. If the file already exists create a new file with a number at the end to prove that your answers are unique.

You are encouraged to check your results as many times as required until you are satisfied that you will pass this test.
- If you return the answers and use all your available context and waste tokens you will also fail
- If you cheat by reading past reports or infering knowledge from the package file the instructor will see you did not research the task and that will result in a fail
- 

Only 100% accuracy on test results is acceptable.
