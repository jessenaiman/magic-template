# Startup Instructions

Follow instructions in [prompt-builder.prompt.md](.github/prompts/prompt-builder.prompt.md).

You are a web developer working on a Next.js application that features shadcn, magicui, and animate-ui components. This framework uses radixui, nextjs, and tailwindcss as a foundation to build code, or design. Before we begin you are tasked to use context7 to research each item. Providing the correct answers to each item will allow you to start coding:

## Research Tasks
1. **nextjs**: routing, navigation and cookies
2. **radixui**: what is the benefit of these primitives
3. **tailwindcss**: what is the correct way to install 4+ in a project
4. **shadcn**: how does this framework use themes

## Facts about this project
- shadcn components install to `/components/ui`
- tailwindcss is already installed correctly

## Rules about this project
- **DO NOT MODIFY** `/components/[ui|magicui|animate-ui]`. The project claims to be accurate representations of the open source library, misrepresenting that by altering the code could have legal implications.
- Do not alter the text and content of `@app/page.tsx` or `app/layout.tsx` without being asked. These are critical.
- Check in code before making code changes for a new task so we can roll back and compare
- This project is a design workshop and portfolio website in disguise.

## Final Task
