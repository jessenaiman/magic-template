# Copilot Agent Context (Consistent Design Page Layout & Customization)

## Recent Technology Decisions
- Centralized layout and customization logic in shared layout component (KISS)
- All customization defaults set in layout, not in individual pages
- Responsive design validated for mobile, tablet, desktop
- shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS used for all controls and layout

## Key Entities
- DesignPage, PreviewTile, CustomizationOption, LayoutComponent

## Outstanding Clarifications
- Should missing customization options block deployment or just warn? (Current: warn, fallback to defaults)
- Minimum supported screen width: 320px

## Last 3 Changes
- Added research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/ for feature 004-1-this-page
- Documented best practices for responsive preview tiles and customization
- Placeholder contract for future server-side customization
